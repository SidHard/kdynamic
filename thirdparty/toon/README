To install on a unix system:

./configure && make && sudo make install

To verify that everything works, you can optioinally run

make test


If you use any LAPACK based features (SVD.h, LU.h, QR_Lapack.h,
SymEigen.h, Lapack_Cholesky.h) you will need to link against LAPACK,
probably using -llapack and perhaps -lblas.


The code is ready to go and should work on any system (unix or non-unix)
without configuring or compiling.
